Project: Secure File Management System

Safeguard File Nexus
A Secure and Encrypted File Management System

Overview
Safeguard File Nexus is a highly secure file management system that ensures safe storage, sharing, and access control for digital files. With features like multi-factor authentication, end-to-end encryption, and real-time threat detection, this system is designed to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

Key Features
User Authentication: Supports password-based and two-factor authentication (2FA) for secure access.

End-to-End Encryption: Files are encrypted before storage and decrypted only on authorized access.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restricts file operations based on user roles and permissions.

File Operations: Securely upload, download, read, write, share, and manage metadata.

Threat Detection: Identifies and mitigates common security threats like malware and buffer overflow attacks.

Audit Logs & Tracking: Logs user activities for security and compliance monitoring.

Scalable & Modular Architecture: Built with scalability in mind to support future enhancements.

Technology Stack
Frontend:
React.js (Modern UI for smooth user experience)

Vite (Fast build tool for efficient development)

ShadCN UI (Enhanced UI components)

Backend:
Node.js & Express.js (Handles authentication, file processing, and security checks)

MongoDB / PostgreSQL (Database for file metadata and user authentication)

JWT Authentication (For secure session handling)

Security Implementations:
AES/RSA encryption for file security

OAuth 2.0 for authentication

Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

System Flow
User logs in with multi-factor authentication.

Files are encrypted before being stored.

Access is granted based on RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

Users can upload, download, share, or modify files securely.

The system continuously monitors for threats like malware or unauthorized access attempts.

Installation & Setup
